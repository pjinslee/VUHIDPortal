VUHIDPortal
===========

A prototype Java servlet web application for interfacing with VUHID, a health IT system hosted by Global Patient Identifiers, Inc.

To compile from source, run "mvn assembly:assembly" from within this directory. Doing so will generate "vuhidportal.zip", which contains everything (aside from third party software and X.509 certificates) necessary for installing VUHID Portal on your server.

If you would rather simply extract and install "vuhidportal.zip" without compiling, checkout the "prebuilt" repository branch.
